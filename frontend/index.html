Accordingly, the application focuses on the presentation of <strong>live</strong> data.</p> <p><img src="/frontend2.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Structure of the application"></p> <p>The application can be divided into <strong>four areas</strong>: the <strong>filter</strong> bar (1), the <strong>list of currently driving truck</strong> (2), the <strong>map overview</strong> (3) and the <strong>detail view</strong> (4) for a selected truck. The four areas are presented below.</p> <h3 id="filter-bar"><a href="#filter-bar" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filter Bar</h3> <p>The filter bar is used to <strong>limit the view</strong> of the trucks according to various criteria.

The Mapbox API is used to display the interactive map. Mapbox is an open source mapping platform for custom designed maps (more information on <a href="https://www.mapbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.mapbox.com<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>). The individual points on the map represent the locations of the different trucks. In the upper left area, <strong>two KPI cards</strong> are positioned, which give information about the <strong>number of delays</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong> (both conspicuous and bad).</p> <p><img src="/frontend4.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Map Overview"></p> <h3 id="detail-view"><a href="#detail-view" class="header-anchor">#</a> Detail View</h3> <p>In the detail view, several details of a <strong>selected truck</strong> are displayed. On the one hand, general information on <strong>the route and the truck</strong> is displayed here. On the other hand, concrete recommendations for various warnings that are already indicated in the <em>list view</em> are displayed in this area.</p> <h5 id="route-information"><a href="#route-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Route Information</h5> <p>The first card shows the selected truck with its departure time and place, planned arrival time and place as well as the current weather and the type of road. The weather information serves to avert the <strong>imminent dangers</strong> associated with <strong>slipperiness</strong>, <strong>wetness</strong> or <strong>restricted visibility</strong> as early as possible. The road information helps to better understand the driving behaviour based on the different types of road, as motorways, for example, have different characteristics than country roads.</p> <p><img src="/frontend5.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Route Information"></p> <h5 id="driving-information"><a href="#driving-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Driving Information</h5> <p>On the second card, three pieces of information about the current trip are displayed: <strong>Speed</strong>, <strong>acceleration</strong> and <strong>consumption</strong>. All three pieces of information are compared to average values calculated for the respective route in the speed layer of the backend (for more information see chapter Backend and Architecture). If the current value is higher than the average value of the route, a warning symbol for the corresponding value is displayed.</p> <p><img src="/frontend6.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Driving Information"></p> <h5 id="driving-behaviour"><a href="#driving-behaviour" class="header-anchor">#</a> Driving Behaviour</h5> <p>The third card shows the truck driver's <strong>driving behaviour</strong>, from which <strong>recommendations</strong> for action can be derived directly. At the top, centrally positioned, there is a bar chart showing the KPI <strong>Eco Status</strong>. <strong>Eco Status</strong> is a key figure calculated from several factors such as <strong>speed</strong>, acceleration, etc. which indicates the driving behaviour of the truck driver. The closer the value is to 100%, the better the driver drives. An Eco Status of 100% means that the driver shows a very good driving behaviour and therefore drives very efficiently in terms of costs. A value of 0%, on the other hand, implies an urgent adjustment of the driving behaviour. In order to get a detailed idea of what is wrong with the driving behaviour, there are four more illustrations below. These show concrete recommendations for action which the driver must implement in order to achieve a better eco status. There are three categories:</p> <ol><li><strong>Normal Behaviour</strong> (indicated by dark grey colouring)
Arrow points to the right: Behaviour does not have to be adapted.</li> <li><strong>Conspicuous Behaviour</strong> (indicated by orange coloring)
Arrow is tilted down 45°: The driving behaviour should be improved.</li> <li><strong>Bad Behaviour</strong> (indicated by red colouring)
Arrow is tilted downwards by 90°: Driving behaviour urgently needs to be improved.</li></ol> <p>The colours and classifications have a direct reference to the &quot;Conspicious&quot; or &quot;Bad&quot; counters shown in the truck cards.</p> <p><img src="/frontend7.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon Driving Behaviour"></p> <h5 id="truck-information"><a href="#truck-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Truck Information</h5> <p>The fourth card shows <strong>general information</strong> about the <strong>truck</strong>. Here again, the warnings are in the foreground. Included are warnings about <strong>tire status</strong>, <strong>engine efficiency</strong> and <strong>truck condition</strong> in general. The gradations are similar to the &quot;Driving Behavior&quot; map.
The example of the <em>tire status</em> is given below to illustrate the gradations:</p> <ol><li><strong>Normal Behaviour</strong> (indicated by dark grey colouring)
Tires are ok.</li> <li><strong>Conspicuous Behaviour</strong> (indicated by orange coloring)
The tires should be checked.</li> <li><strong>Bad Behaviour</strong> (indicated by red colouring)
The tyres need to be checked.</li></ol> <p>Similarly, the factors <em>engine efficiency</em> and general <em>truck condition</em> are graded.</p> <p>With the information <strong>vehicle type</strong>, <strong>year</strong> of manufacture, <strong>mass</strong> and next <strong>service</strong>, the fleet manager receives even more detailed information about the truck. This allows him to interpret further conclusions about the <strong>driving behaviour</strong> (e.g. a truck with a larger mass has a different acceleration behaviour than a truck with a lower mass) or the <strong>maintenance susceptibility</strong> (e.g. depending on the age of the truck and the next service due).</p> <p><img src="/frontend8.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Truck Information"></p> <h3 id="interactivity"><a href="#interactivity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interactivity</h3> <p>The application provides some interactions that help the user to view the desired information as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p> <h4 id="selection-of-a-truck"><a href="#selection-of-a-truck" class="header-anchor">#</a> Selection of a truck</h4> <p>To select a truck, the user can either click on the map within the list area or select the truck on the map.</p> <p><img src="/frontend9.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Selection of a truck"></p> <h4 id="filter"><a href="#filter" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filter</h4> <p>As already mentioned, it is possible to filter by the criteria <strong>delay</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong>. The selection can be reset to the default value by clicking the <em>Clear</em> button. You can filter by delays by selecting a delay interval.</p> <p><img src="/frontend10.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Filter"></p> <p>Warnings can be filtered by enabling/disabling the <em>Only Warnings</em> switcher.</p> <h4 id="helper"><a href="#helper" class="header-anchor">#</a> Helper</h4> <p>Within the detailed overview there are <strong>helper icons</strong> (symbolized as quesion mark icons), which should help the user to <strong>get familiar</strong> with the application <strong>faster</strong>. By clicking on the icon, a pop-up window is displayed that explains the elements of the respective card in <strong>more detail</strong> or shows how the individual symbols and colors are to be <strong>interpreted</strong>.</p> <p><img src="/frontend11.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Helpertext"></p> <h2 id="data-source"><a href="#data-source" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Source</h2> <p>The frontend is connected to the backend via a <strong>REST API</strong>. The application uses an <em>HTTP-GET-Request</em> in intervals of 60 seconds to check whether changes have been made to the data and renders only the components affected by the changes. The <strong>JSON</strong> (<em>JavaScript Object Notation</em>) data format is used for data exchange, since it supports good readability on the developer side and is independent of the script language on the machine side. Below is an excerpt from the JSON of a truck.</p> <p><img src="/frontend12.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Data Format"></p> <blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: For more information about the data and its calculations, visit the <a href="/backend"><em>Backend</em></a> and <a href="/datasource"><em>Data Source</em></a> section.</p></blockquote> <h1 id="challenges"><a href="#challenges" class="header-anchor">#</a> Challenges</h1> <p>During the development we were confronted with several <strong>challenges</strong>. These can be grouped into challenges related to the <strong>business case</strong>, challenges related to the <strong>architecture</strong> and last but not least challenges related to the <strong>presentation</strong> of the data. The most important of these are shown below.</p> <h3 id="business-case"><a href="#business-case" class="header-anchor">#</a> Business Case</h3> <p>During the development of the application we dealt iteratively with the following questions.</p> <ul><li>Which information is <strong>relevant</strong> for the target groups? Which information has a rather <strong>high priority</strong>, which a rather <strong>low priority</strong>?</li> <li>Which <strong>main benefit</strong> should the application offer?</li></ul> <p>Several wireframes were created during the development process. On the business case level the challenges mentioned so far were evaluated. In addition, the following question was also discussed:</p> <ul><li>Is it clearly <strong>communicable</strong> and <strong>plausible</strong> for the respective target group?</li></ul> <h3 id="architecture"><a href="#architecture" class="header-anchor">#</a> Architecture</h3> <p>The architecture of the application is complex, which resulted in immediate challenges for the development.</p> <p>One challenge was the <strong>data connection</strong>. Since we only deal with live data, a <strong>dummy pipeline</strong> had to be created to test the behaviour of the frontend in case of data changes.</p> <p>In addition, a high degree of <strong>data consistency</strong> had to be guaranteed, since the target group in particular expects the data from the back end to be displayed in the front end <strong>without corruption</strong>.</p> <p>Furthermore, it could be determined that the application in a productive, deployed environment shows fundamental differences to the development environment in <strong>data retrieval</strong>. Especially the asynchronous queries often led to <strong>unexpected</strong> <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/de/definition/Race-Condition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">race conditions<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> in the deployed state.</p> <p>Last but not least, a <strong>constant exchange</strong> between backend and frontend developers was necessary, since even the smallest changes on the backend side could cause the frontend application to stop working. To ensure a certain degree of reliability, a <strong>data catalog</strong> was created in advance, which defines the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>format</strong> and <strong>value range</strong> of every attribute.</p> <h3 id="presentation"><a href="#presentation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Presentation</h3> <p>In close coordination with the backend, a lot of data was available which had to be mapped. The structuring and simultaneous translation of the data into <strong>user-friendly</strong> information proved to be a challenge. Thus, it had to be differentiated which information was <strong>relevant at first glance</strong> and which could be categorized as <strong>details</strong>. Furthermore, a certain degree of <strong>liveliness</strong> of the information had to be introduced. Thus, the application should not only provide information and recommendations for action on the various trucks, but should also be <strong>fun to use</strong>.</p> <p>But also the development of the <strong>interactions</strong>, in particular the development of the <strong>filters</strong>, presented a challenge. The selection of a truck, as well as the change of the data in the background had a direct effect on all related components. For example, when a truck is selected in the <em>list of currently driving trucks</em>, it must be ensured that it is both highlighted on the map and its details are displayed in the detail view. At the same time it had to be intercepted that the selection of the truck crashes when the data in the background is changed.</p> <h2 id="contributors"><a href="#contributors" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contributors</h2> <p><strong>Anja Stütz</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Hermann</strong> were mainly involved in the development of the frontend.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
