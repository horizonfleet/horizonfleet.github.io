The main goal is to optimize the costs of truck fleets by means of data analysis and a dashboard. In order to work as realistically as possible, the task was seen as the assignment of a fictional company. Accordingly, we as a group find ourselves in the role of the consultants who develop a product for this company.</p> <p><strong>Current situation at the fleet enterprise</strong></p> <p>The existing communication channel in the company provides for a driver to report current events to the fleet managers, who in turn respond with instructions.</p> <p><img src="/fleet_situation?raw=true" alt="Fleet Situation"></p> <p>In the past, the fleet manager had little overview of the current position and situation of the trucks. A newly introduced telemetry module (represented by a simulation in the project) in the trucks now allows the transmission of important information about the position and situation of the truck to the head office. However, up to now the control center can hardly do anything with this information and therefore needs a suitable dashboard and data modeling.</p> <h3 id="task"><a href="#task" class="header-anchor">#</a> Task</h3> <p><strong>The following predefined Tasks were given</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Dashboard design for data visualization after expansion of an existing database with two options:</li> <li>Option 1: Batch analysis and creation of a dashboard for the user &quot;fleet management&quot; as well as selection and application of a DM clustering algorithm</li> <li>Option 2: Real-time analysis and creation of a dashboard for the users &quot;fleet management&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; (indirect) as well as selection and application for real-time visual monitoring</li></ul> <p>To fit the scope and the predefined use-case of the fleet enterprise, option two was chosen.</p> <p><strong>&quot;Real-time analysis and creation of a dashboard for the users &quot;fleet management&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; (indirect) as well as selection and application for visual monitoring in real time&quot;.</strong></p> <h3 id="research"><a href="#research" class="header-anchor">#</a> Research</h3> <p>In order to understand the scope of the project better and to bring all team members up to the same level, design thinking methods were applied first.</p> <p>To get a first impression, Brainstorming was chosen as the first method.

<code>{&quot;truckCond&quot;:1,&quot;timeStamp&quot;:1595455986000,&quot;speed&quot;:13.05292451466845,&quot;avgIntervSpeed&quot;:10.38730585107233, &quot;secSinceLast&quot;:120,&quot;acceleration&quot;:1.5121130926381294,&quot;bearing&quot;:315.8724852614906,&quot;mass&quot;:27636.0, &quot;consumption&quot;:11.251371489442374,&quot;lat&quot;:51.05354230592819,&quot;lon&quot;:13.724075328077138,&quot;engineEff&quot;:0, &quot;tireEff&quot;:0,&quot;truckYear&quot;:2014,&quot;truckType&quot;:2,&quot;speedWarn&quot;:0,&quot;accWarn&quot;:1,&quot;brakeWarn&quot;:0,&quot;incident&quot;:false, &quot;routeId&quot;:&quot;5f070923c92647260c2b28e9&quot;,&quot;tripId&quot;:&quot;278JHYXZAW&quot;,&quot;truckLP&quot;:&quot;S HZ 9831&quot;, &quot;truckId&quot;:&quot;5f070923c92647260c2b28f1&quot;,&quot;roadType&quot;:1,&quot;arrived&quot;:0}</code></p> <p>We can see that there are a few data points which help to identify a record.
Such are:</p> <ul><li>truckId (and truckLP - license plate)</li> <li>routeId</li> <li>tripId</li> <li>timeStamp</li></ul> <p>Most data points deliver updates on the state the truck is in. Examples for this are:</p> <ul><li>truckCond</li> <li>lat and lon (latitude and longitude)</li> <li>acceleration</li></ul> <h4 id="data-amounts-and-format"><a href="#data-amounts-and-format" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data amounts and format</h4> <p>The simulation can run at arbitrary speed and can send messages in custom time intervals. There are therefore two controlling settings controlling the amount of messages which are received from the simulation.
The amount of milliseconds in real time that are required to pass for one second in the simulation and the message interval in which trucks send in seconds.
Assuming an interval of 120 seconds with the simulation running in real time, this means that on average, a message from a truck is received every two seconds.</p> <p>Variables providing information on the state the truck or its components are in are encoded in a three tier system:</p> <ul><li>0: normal status</li> <li>1: conspicuous status</li> <li>2: bad status</li></ul> <p>Identifying information is mostly delivered as string. Most other variables are provided in numeric format such as the coordinates, timestamp (unix time) or consumption.</p> <h4 id="data-exploration"><a href="#data-exploration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Exploration</h4> <p>As the focus on the project lied on live streaming data to a dashboard, data exploration was mainly carried out to ensure data quality and consistency.</p> <p>For a simulation with many trucks and a sufficiently large time-frame of multiple days it was found that moving variables such as speed and acceleration are normally distributed.
Trucks send their data in reliable intervals and drive on their assigned routes. They commence to a different destination after a random delay (driver gets a break).</p> <h3 id="contributors-to-the-data-source"><a href="#contributors-to-the-data-source" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contributors to the Data Source</h3> <p><strong>Anja St√ºtz</strong> and <strong>Jan Anders</strong> were mainly involved in the development of the data source.</p> <h2 id="_3-data-preparation-speed-layer"><a href="#_3-data-preparation-speed-layer" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Data Preparation - Speed Layer</h2> <p>Responsible: David Rundel, Jan Anders, Anja St√ºtz</p> <p>The following paragraph will focus on the data preparation and aggreagtion as it is performed in the speed layer.
This closly represents the Data Preparation phase of the CRISP-DM approach. However, it does not cover the process for selecting relevant variables during development of the solution. A few remarks on this step will be given after the documentation of the speed layer.</p> <hr> <h3 id="input"><a href="#input" class="header-anchor">#</a> Input</h3> <p>The Speed Layer processes the simulation-data which is consumed from a Kafka-Stream.
After parsing the JSON-data, it gets converted to a pyspark-DataFrame (pyspark.sql.DataFrame).</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>df = spark.readStream.format(&quot;kafka&quot;) \
    .option(&quot;kafka.bootstrap.servers&quot;, &quot;kafka:9092&quot;) \

    .select(col('value.*')) \
</code></pre></div><h3 id="transformation"><a href="#transformation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transformation</h3> <p>In the transformation phase, the data goes through several steps: Filtering, Harmonization, Aggregation, Enrichment. The Filtering- and Harmonization-Phase are less needed due to the fact that most of the data comes from the same simulated data source and is pretty much homogeneous. For real world data, this processing step would have to be extended.</p> <h4 id="aggregation"><a href="#aggregation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Aggregation</h4> <p>The incoming data-stream gets aggregated by each trip.</p> <ul><li>Master-data (such as the corresponding route, truck or trip) is saved once.</li> <li>Moving-data is converted to time series. This enables the resource efficient historization of the data for later use in the Batch Layer. The time series are of use for computing metrics like averages, moving averages (not implemented in the latest version), standard-deviations (not implemented), and for deriving most recent values, which are used in the frontend.</li> <li>As mentioned above, moving data for which only the last value is of relevance to the frontend is saved in a separate field to be forwarded to the frontend api. Some constantly changing values which are not of importance for machine learning (such as the weather, which currently has no influence on the simulation) are treated the same way to save on resources. In a production environment, it would be a good idea to save everything to the batch database in case this data is needed in the future for different use cases.</li></ul> <p>An example of all three aggregation types:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>df_serve = df_serve \
    .groupBy('tripId') \
    .agg(F.first(&quot;truckId&quot;).alias(&quot;sd_truckId&quot;), \

    F.avg('consumption').alias(&quot;agg_last_consumption&quot;))
</code></pre></div><h4 id="enrichment"><a href="#enrichment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Enrichment</h4> <p>Additional master-data is joined, such as the length of each route, to compute metrics like the current progress per trip. The length of each route is a static dataframe that does not require recomputation in the batch-layer. Rather, this dataframe would have to be updated by a route planning system as soon as a new route is entered into the system.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>AS.download_file(save_path, cloud_file_name, container_name)
route_dist_pd = pd.read_csv(&quot;./route_dist.csv&quot;)
route_dist = sqlCtx.createDataFrame(route_dist_pd)

</code></pre></div><p>Historical aggregates, stemming from the Batch Layer, are used to compute Delta-KPIs. Those fulfill the purpose to better assess current data, when seeing it in relation to values which can be considered normal for each route. For this, similar to joining master data above, aggregation data is joined and then used set current values into comparison. The aggregations are periodically recomputed by the batch layer to ensure that averages are up to date.</p> <p>External datasources, such as the current weather for each truck, get joined as additional data for the frontend. A custom weather api caller was defined in order to obtain weather codes in concordance with the frontend specification. Additional information, such as a description of the weather, the temperature or humidity would also be available.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>@udf(&quot;integer&quot;)

</code></pre></div><p>Machine Learning Models are used as inference-engines, to enrich the streaming data with predictions, such as the delay per trip. The models are fetched from Azure Blob Storage.

Modeling - Batch Layer</h2> <p>Responsible: David Rundel</p> <p>In the modeling phase, we ended up with two models. One supervised, and one unsupervised approach.</p> <p>We clustered the driver-habits using the spark-proprietary K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm and evaluated the models with Silhouettes. Incremental-Model-Training / Online-Training was considered for the clustering, but could not yet be implemented.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>CL_kmeans = KMeans() \
	    .setK(3) \

	    .setFeaturesCol(&quot;scaledFeatures&quot;)

</code></pre></div><p>The GBT-Algorithm was challenged against LSTM-Networks, which held the potential to make better use of Time Series Data. However, while the data is available in time series format, the prediction is a regression task and heavily profits from the ability of GBT to learn different patterns in data. Unfortunately the LSTM, implemented with Keras and Tensoflow as Backend, was not able to achieve better results than the sequentially growing decision trees.
In the next iteration of the data science process, it could be tried to predict the delay using a multi model or multi input model approach with LSTM's and dense networks, concatenating several input streams with different dimensionality. This would not only process time-series, but also one-dimensional master data, which turned out to be a good predictor with the GBT. Anyway, the LSTM code can be found in /Backend/Kafka/mvp/batch_layer/NN_Test.py.</p> <p>For both models, hyperparameters were optimized with the help of a Grid Search. The grid could be extended by further variables if better results are required, it is however more likely that training data amounts and data preparation play a bigger role in the quality of the models.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>EA_paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \

This is for two reasons:
Firstly, Azure is currently shaping to be the main competitor to the industry leading Amazon Web Services and offers a free student credit program, making it well suited for a study project.
Secondly, while some team-members had previous experience with Googles' Cloud Plattform, another option with a student credit offering, we wanted to gain experience with another solution.</p> <p>We did not expect that hosting our solution would require as many resources, but in the end the student credit of multiple accounts was fully used up.</p> <p>Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Cosmos DB were chosen early in the process as the two main components on which Horizon runs. Subsequent architecture and tool decisions were made accordingly.</p> <p>After testing parts of the solution in clusters or containers on local machines, the live deployment only required small changes to the general workflow, the largest being heavy wait times while waiting for container images to upload for live testing.</p> <p>As Horizon was developed as a prototype and underwent constant changes, in addition to the high cost of hosting the service, Horizon did not run online for extendend periods of time. This means that no large database of data for training could be collected.
Monitoring was therefore not required (and would have cost additional credit). The Batch Database did not reach full capacity and remained below the free tier of 400 RU/s for the duration of the project.</p> <p>Final Presentation
During the live presentation of the system, Horizon was deployed and the frontend was publicly available.
Given that enough funds remain, the Horizon dashboard will be available <a href="janders.net/horizon">here</a> as a static application in the first week of August, 2020 for trying out features (such as filter criteria), which could not be shown during the presentation.</p> <h2 id="contributors"><a href="#contributors" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contributors</h2> <p><strong>David Rundel</strong>, <strong>Felix Bieswanger</strong> and <strong>Jan Anders</strong> were maily involved in the development of the backend and deployment.</p> <h1 id="frontend"><a href="#frontend" class="header-anchor">#</a> Frontend</h1> <p>This is the official documentation of the frontend of <strong>Horizon</strong>.

The individual points on the map represent the locations of the different trucks. In the upper left area, <strong>two KPI cards</strong> are positioned, which give information about the <strong>number of delays</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong> (both conspicuous and bad).
<img src="/frontend4.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Map Overview"></p> <h3 id="detail-view"><a href="#detail-view" class="header-anchor">#</a> Detail View</h3> <p>In the detail view, several details of a <strong>selected truck</strong> are displayed. On the one hand, general information on <strong>the route and the truck</strong> is displayed here. On the other hand, concrete recommendations for various warnings that are already indicated in the <em>list view</em> are displayed in this area.</p> <h5 id="route-information"><a href="#route-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Route Information</h5> <p>The first card shows the selected truck with its departure time and place, planned arrival time and place as well as the current weather and the type of road. The weather information serves to avert the <strong>imminent dangers</strong> associated with <strong>slipperiness</strong>, <strong>wetness</strong> or <strong>restricted visibility</strong> as early as possible. The road information helps to better understand the driving behaviour based on the different types of road, as motorways, for example, have different characteristics than country roads.</p> <p><img src="/frontend5.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Route Information"></p> <h5 id="driving-information"><a href="#driving-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Driving Information</h5> <p>On the second card, three pieces of information about the current trip are displayed: <strong>Speed</strong>, <strong>acceleration</strong> and <strong>consumption</strong>. All three pieces of information are compared to average values calculated for the respective route in the speed layer of the backend (for more information see chapter Backend and Architecture). If the current value is higher than the average value of the route, a warning symbol for the corresponding value is displayed.</p> <p><img src="/frontend6.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Driving Information"></p> <h5 id="driving-behaviour"><a href="#driving-behaviour" class="header-anchor">#</a> Driving Behaviour</h5> <p>The third card shows the truck driver's <strong>driving behaviour</strong>, from which <strong>recommendations</strong> for action can be derived directly. At the top, centrally positioned, there is a bar chart showing the KPI <strong>Eco Status</strong>. <strong>Eco Status</strong> is a key figure calculated from several factors such as <strong>speed</strong>, acceleration, etc. which indicates the driving behaviour of the truck driver. The closer the value is to 100%, the better the driver drives. An Eco Status of 100% means that the driver shows a very good driving behaviour and therefore drives very efficiently in terms of costs. A value of 0%, on the other hand, implies an urgent adjustment of the driving behaviour. In order to get a detailed idea of what is wrong with the driving behaviour, there are four more illustrations below. These show concrete recommendations for action which the driver must implement in order to achieve a better eco status. There are three categories:</p> <ol><li><strong>Normal Behaviour</strong> (indicated by dark grey colouring)
Arrow points to the right: Behaviour does not have to be adapted.</li> <li><strong>Conspicuous Behaviour</strong> (indicated by orange coloring)
Arrow is tilted down 45¬∞: The driving behaviour should be improved.</li> <li><strong>Bad Behaviour</strong> (indicated by red colouring)
Arrow is tilted downwards by 90¬∞: Driving behaviour urgently needs to be improved.</li></ol> <p>The colours and classifications have a direct reference to the &quot;Conspicious&quot; or &quot;Bad&quot; counters shown in the truck cards.</p> <p><img src="/frontend7.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon Driving Behaviour"></p> <h5 id="truck-information"><a href="#truck-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Truck Information</h5> <p>The fourth card shows <strong>general information</strong> about the <strong>truck</strong>. Here again, the warnings are in the foreground. Included are warnings about <strong>tire status</strong>, <strong>engine efficiency</strong> and <strong>truck condition</strong> in general. The gradations are similar to the &quot;Driving Behavior&quot; map.
The example of the <em>tire status</em> is given below to illustrate the gradations:</p> <ol><li><strong>Normal Behaviour</strong> (indicated by dark grey colouring)
Tires are ok.</li> <li><strong>Conspicuous Behaviour</strong> (indicated by orange coloring)
The tires should be checked.</li> <li><strong>Bad Behaviour</strong> (indicated by red colouring)
The tyres need to be checked.</li></ol> <p>Similarly, the factors <em>engine efficiency</em> and general <em>truck condition</em> are graded.</p> <p>With the information <strong>vehicle type</strong>, <strong>year</strong> of manufacture, <strong>mass</strong> and next <strong>service</strong>, the fleet manager receives even more detailed information about the truck. This allows him to interpret further conclusions about the <strong>driving behaviour</strong> (e.g. a truck with a larger mass has a different acceleration behaviour than a truck with a lower mass) or the <strong>maintenance susceptibility</strong> (e.g. depending on the age of the truck and the next service due).</p> <p><img src="/frontend8.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Truck Information"></p> <h3 id="interactivity"><a href="#interactivity" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interactivity</h3> <p>The application provides some interactions that help the user to view the desired information as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p> <h4 id="selection-of-a-truck"><a href="#selection-of-a-truck" class="header-anchor">#</a> Selection of a truck</h4> <p>To select a truck, the user can either click on the map within the list area or select the truck on the map.</p> <p><img src="/frontend9.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon: Selection of a truck"></p> <h4 id="filter"><a href="#filter" class="header-anchor">#</a> Filter</h4> <p>As already mentioned, it is possible to filter by the criteria <strong>delay</strong> and <strong>warnings</strong>.

The most important of these are shown below.</p> <h3 id="business-case"><a href="#business-case" class="header-anchor">#</a> Business Case</h3> <p>During the development of the application we dealt iteratively with the following questions.</p> <ul><li>Which information is <strong>relevant</strong> for the target groups? Which information has a rather <strong>high priority</strong>, which a rather <strong>low priority</strong>?</li> <li>Which <strong>main benefit</strong> should the application offer?</li></ul> <p>Several wireframes were created during the development process. On the business case level the challenges mentioned so far were evaluated. In addition, the following question was also discussed:</p> <ul><li>Is it clearly <strong>communicable</strong> and <strong>plausible</strong> for the respective target group?</li></ul> <h3 id="architecture"><a href="#architecture" class="header-anchor">#</a> Architecture</h3> <p>The architecture of the application is complex, which resulted in immediate challenges for the development.</p> <p>One challenge was the <strong>data connection</strong>. Since we only deal with live data, a <strong>dummy pipeline</strong> had to be created to test the behaviour of the frontend in case of data changes.</p> <p>In addition, a high degree of <strong>data consistency</strong> had to be guaranteed, since the target group in particular expects the data from the back end to be displayed in the front end <strong>without corruption</strong>.</p> <p>Furthermore, it could be determined that the application in a productive, deployed environment shows fundamental differences to the development environment in <strong>data retrieval</strong>. Especially the asynchronous queries often led to <strong>unexpected</strong> <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/de/definition/Race-Condition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">race conditions<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> in the deployed state.</p> <p>Last but not least, a <strong>constant exchange</strong> between backend and frontend developers was necessary, since even the smallest changes on the backend side could cause the frontend application to stop working. To ensure a certain degree of reliability, a <strong>data catalog</strong> was created in advance, which defines the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>format</strong> and <strong>value range</strong> of every attribute.</p> <h3 id="presentation"><a href="#presentation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Presentation</h3> <p>In close coordination with the backend, a lot of data was available which had to be mapped. The structuring and simultaneous translation of the data into <strong>user-friendly</strong> information proved to be a challenge. Thus, it had to be differentiated which information was <strong>relevant at first glance</strong> and which could be categorized as <strong>details</strong>. Furthermore, a certain degree of <strong>liveliness</strong> of the information had to be introduced. Thus, the application should not only provide information and recommendations for action on the various trucks, but should also be <strong>fun to use</strong>.</p> <p>But also the development of the <strong>interactions</strong>, in particular the development of the <strong>filters</strong>, presented a challenge. The selection of a truck, as well as the change of the data in the background had a direct effect on all related components. For example, when a truck is selected in the <em>list of currently driving trucks</em>, it must be ensured that it is both highlighted on the map and its details are displayed in the detail view. At the same time it had to be intercepted that the selection of the truck crashes when the data in the background is changed.</p> <h2 id="contributors-to-the-frontend"><a href="#contributors-to-the-frontend" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contributors to the Frontend</h2> <p><strong>Anja St√ºtz</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Hermann</strong> were mainly involved in the development of the frontend.</p> <h3 id="anja-stutz"><a href="#anja-stutz" class="header-anchor">#</a> Anja St√ºtz</h3> <p>Information Science Student at the Stuttgart Media University.
