The Cross-industry standard process for data mining is separated in 6 steps - the first step is included in this page, the second step can be found in the <a href="/datasource"><em>Data Source</em></a> section.</p> <p>However, this project has went through many more stages than are found in a typical data science / data mining process, mainly due to the data streaming nature of Horizon.
The documentation is therefore enriched with ideas and results from the design thinking process as well as a description of other steps that were part of the project.</p> <p><img src="/design_thinking.png" alt="Desgin Thinking Process"></p> <p>In the conclusion, we give a resume of what we learned, difficulties and challenges we faced and how Horizon could be further improved.</p> <h1 id="design-thinking"><a href="#design-thinking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Design Thinking</h1> <p>Following is the description of the first stage inside the CRISP-DM process model.

The main goal is to optimize the costs of truck fleets by data analysis and a dashboard. In order to work as realistically as possible, the task was seen as the assignment of a fictional company. Accordingly, we as a group find ourselves in the role of the consultants who develop a product for this company.</p> <p><strong>Current situation at the fleet enterprise</strong></p> <p>The existing communication in the company provides for a driver to report current events to a fleet managers who will respond with instructions.</p> <p><img src="/fleetsituation.png?raw=true" alt="Fleet Management"></p> <p>In the past, the fleet manager had only little overview of the current position and situation of the trucks. A newly introduced telemetry module (represented by a simulation in the project) in the trucks now allows the transmission of important information about the position and situation of the truck to the office. However, until now the control center can hardly do anything with this information and therefore needs a suitable dashboard and data modeling.</p> <h3 id="task"><a href="#task" class="header-anchor">#</a> Task</h3> <p><strong>The following predefined Tasks were given</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Dashboard design for data visualization after expansion of an existing database with two options:</li> <li>Option 1: Batch analysis and creation of a dashboard for the user &quot;fleet management&quot; as well as selection and application of a DM clustering algorithm</li> <li>Option 2: Real-time analysis and creation of a dashboard for the users &quot;fleet management&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; (indirect) as well as selection and application for real-time visual monitoring</li></ul> <p>To fit the scope and the predefined use-case of the fleet enterprise, option two was chosen.</p> <p><strong>&quot;Real-time analysis and creation of a dashboard for the users &quot;fleet management&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; (indirect) as well as selection and application for visual monitoring in real time&quot;.</strong></p> <p><strong>The following objectives were to be pursued:</strong></p> <ul><li>Adjustment of the parameters for realistic simulation</li> <li>Visualization of the data</li> <li>Derivation of recommendations for action from visualized data</li></ul> <h3 id="understanding-the-scope-and-research"><a href="#understanding-the-scope-and-research" class="header-anchor">#</a> Understanding the Scope and Research</h3> <p>In order to understand the scope of the project and to bring all team members up to the same level, design thinking methods were applied first. Brainstorming was chosen as the first method to get a first impression. The results are presented below.

Nevertheless, it is possible to optimize the drivers and thus make savings elsewhere. With the help of instructions from the Fleet Manager, the driver's driving style can be improved and costs in other areas such as fuel consumption can be achieved. A fleet manager can also use the dashboard to detect technical problems at an early stage and pass them on to the driver. The driver is sensitized to this and in the future can even recognize the warning signs of technical problems at an early stage: ‚ÄûErkennt der Fahrer die Warnzeichen nicht rechtzeitig, droht ein Platzer des Turboladers‚Äú <a href="https://www.adac.de/produkte/truck-service/presse/meldungen/wartungsintervalle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(ADAC, 2016)<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><strong>Direct cost savings</strong></p> <p><strong>- Maintanance and Service Costs</strong></p> <p>Cost savings through extended maintenance and repair intervals are not recommended, otherwise damage to the motor or other engine components may occur.

This can also be minimized by displaying the technical status in the dashboard and allowing an early detection of major technical problems and negative aftereffects. At the same time, the dashboard can be used to remind the driver of regular maintenance and repair intervals.</p> <p><strong>- Costs for fuel, oil and other lubricants</strong></p> <p>The costs for fuel, oil and lubricants are highly variable and depend on a wide range of parameters such as speed, braking behaviour, truck model and many more. The exact dependency and influence of different parameters are explained in detail in the following chapter of the simulation as they are used there significantly for a realistic data simulation.
Besides the costs, savings also mean to protect the environment: &quot;Neben der wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung fuÃàr den Spediteur bedeutet verringerter Dieselverbrauch auch aktiven Umweltschutz. Je weniger Diesel der Motor verbraucht, desto weniger CO2 erzeugt er. Ein Liter gesparter Dieselkraftstoff entspricht einer Erleichterung fuÃàr unsere Umwelt von rund 2,6 kg des Treibhausgases Kohlendioxid CO2.&quot; (Hilgers, p. 4, 2016)</p> <h2 id="derived-kpi-for-the-project"><a href="#derived-kpi-for-the-project" class="header-anchor">#</a> Derived KPI for the project</h2> <p>The following KPIs were determined on the basis of research and the examination of cost factors:</p> <ul><li>Fuel consumption

Also we decieded that the project needs an unique project name, which symbolizes the endless possibilities of the fleet management project. Therefore Horizon was chosen as a metaphor of endless driving. The name also fits the idea of a modern, slightly futuristic design and outcome.</p> <p>To complete the corporate identity shades of blue were chosen as the main color, wich can be found in the dashboard, presentation, logo and documentation.</p> <p><img src="/color_scheme.png?raw=true" alt="Color Scheme"></p> <p>Based on the name and color scheme a logo is designed in an iterative process. Below are all considerations until the final logo on the bottom right.</p> <p><img src="/all_logos.png?raw=true" alt="Horizon Logo"></p> <h3 id="prototype-dashboard-design"><a href="#prototype-dashboard-design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Prototype: Dashboard Design</h3> <p>Besides the logo, the dashboard is also design through an iterative process.</p> <p>First, it was important to put all the information into one interface and evaluation the outcome with the scope (Personas, KPI) of the project.</p> <p><img src="/dashboard_old.png?raw=true" alt="Old Dashboard Designs"></p> <p>The left approach is way too loaded and complex. A fleet manager needs a quick, clean interface from which he can read off the most important values without searching or distraction. Also it is way to dark, which quickly leds to the decision of a light colored dashboard with blue highlights. The right approach is better but the dominant map repress the KPIs below. Also the Map of Germany is more vertical then horizontal which is not highlighted by the design.</p> <p>Between the first two approaches and the third final dashboard design approach, many little adaptions and rough sketches (Powerpoint, Pen &amp; Paper, Adobe XD) helped to finalize the design. Below is an impression of the intermediate step:</p> <p><img src="/sub_step.png?raw=true" alt="substeps"></p> <p>The third design was the final outcome and reflects the need of the fleet manager (who loves having an overview, is analytic and hates chaos) with a clean and light design, displaying an overview with a map and truck list but allowing to go deeper with adjustment options and detail lists.
